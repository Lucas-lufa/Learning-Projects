0 Melt the chocolate in a bowl over hot water. Whisk the egg yolks and sugar until very thick and creamy. Beat in the melted chocolate, whisk the egg whites until stiff then fold into the chocolate mixture with the cocoa using a metal spoon. Fold the mixture into a greased 93 x 33cm (9" x 13") Swiss roll tin. Bake in a pre-heated oven 180°C/350°F Gas Mark 4 for about 30 mins, or until well risen & firm to the touch. 
@ Turn the roulade out onto a sheet of greaseproof paper covered with caster sugar. Peel away the lining paper. Cover the roulade with a clean damp tea-towel and leave to cool. 
0 To make the filling, whip the cream with the icing sugar until quite firm. Fold in the creme fraiche. Spread the cream over the roulade and sprinkle with the raspberries. Starting from the narrow ends, carefully roll up the roulade using the paper to help. Dust generously with sifted icing sugar. 
0 To make the sauce, make a puree of the raspberries, reserving a few whole ones, by pushing through a sieve or placing in a food blender and then sieving to remove the pips. Add the liqueur and sweeten to taste with some icing sugar. 
@ To serve, slice the roulade and lay a slice on each serving plate. Cover the well of the plate with sauce. Place a few whole raspberries on each plate. Using a small piping bag place a few drops of cream around the edge of the sauce. Pull out from the centre of each dot 5 times with a cocktail stick to create a star.
