git and github

git clone

A clone is a full copy of a repository, including all logging and versions of files. Git can clone from github so there is a local copy to work from. 

I will clone the web developer github repository that Andy made for the class. Then make a fork of that repostory on my github account. That will enable me to push any changes from my git to the fork on github. From that fork I can make a pull requset to Andy's repostory, the upstream.

git clone https://github.com/AdyGCode/C4-23-S1-WT-Learning.git

I have made a fork of Andy's reposorty on my github account https://github.com/Lucas-lufa
at https://github.com/Lucas-lufa/C4-23-S1-WT-Learning/tree/main and the git repository's url( think uniform resource locator is the correct term) https://github.com/Lucas-lufa/C4-23-S1-WT-Learning.git

Configuring remotes
The full copy of the repository we have can not make changes to the orginal on github.

to see how the remotes of this git is set up:
$ git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/AdyGCode/C4-23-S1-WT-Learning.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/AdyGCode/C4-23-S1-WT-Learning.git (push)

we see that orgin is set to AdyGCode reposotory we also want to add my fork.

First we want to rename the original origin remote to upstream.
$ git remote rename origin upstream
Renaming remote references: 100% (3/3), done.
$ git remote -v
upstream        https://github.com/AdyGCode/C4-23-S1-WT-Learning.git (fetch)
upstream        https://github.com/AdyGCode/C4-23-S1-WT-Learning.git (push)

use you own url in this case 
https://github.com/Lucas-lufa/C4-23-S1-WT-Learning.git
and add that as origin
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/Lucas-lufa/C4-23-S1-WT-Learning.git
$ git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/Lucas-lufa/C4-23-S1-WT-Learning.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/Lucas-lufa/C4-23-S1-WT-Learning.git (push)
upstream        https://github.com/AdyGCode/C4-23-S1-WT-Learning.git (fetch)
upstream        https://github.com/AdyGCode/C4-23-S1-WT-Learning.git (push)

According to git naming conventions, it is recommeded to name your own repository origin, and the one you forked for upstream

Now we have two remotes:
origin - our own fork, where we have read and write access.
upstream - the original, where we have read-only access.
